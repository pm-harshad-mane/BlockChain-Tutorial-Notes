Important Concepts of block chain
- Hash Cryptography
- Immutable Ledger
- Distributed P2P Network
- Mining
- Consensus Protocol

--------------------- --------------------- --------------------- --------------------- 

## Hash Cryptography
- Fingerprints are 1 in 60M

## Requirements of Hash Also
- one way
- Deterministic
- Fast Computation
- The Avalanche Effect: small change in input should reflect change in hash value
- Must withstand collisions: collisions will happen but must be rare, it should not be possible to intentionaaly create the input to create a desired hash value

## SHA256 by NSA
- Secure Hash Algo using 256 bits
- Hexadecimal hash
- 64 Chars string is generated

## Immutable Ledger
- a ledger that can not be modified by un-authorized person
